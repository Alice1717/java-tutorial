## Q17 OOPs Concepts in Java?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). Java is an object-oriented programming language that follows the principles of OOPs. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/oops-concept)

## Q18 Classes in Java?
In Java, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It encapsulates data for the object attributes and the behaviour of the object methods. It defines the structure and behaviour of objects by specifying attributes (data fields) and methods (functions) that the objects will have. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/class)

## Q19 Object in Java?
In Java, an object is a fundamental unit of object-oriented programming (OOP) that represents a real-world entity. Objects are instances of classes and are created using the new keyword followed by a constructor call.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/object)

## Q20 Constructor Method in Java?
In Java, a constructor method is a special type of method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created using the "new" keyword. Constructors are used to initialize the newly created object, typically by setting initial values for its attributes or performing other setup tasks.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/constructor)

## Q21 this Keyword in Java?
In Java, the "this" keyword is a reference to the current object within an instance method or a constructor. It can be used to refer to the current instance's attributes, invoke other constructors within the same class, and pass the current object as an argument to other methods.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/this-keyword)

## Q22 static Keyword in Java?
In Java, the "static" keyword is used to declare members (variables and methods) that belong to the class itself, rather than to individual instances (objects) of the class. 
When a member is declared as "static", it is shared by all instances of the class and can be accessed directly using the class name, without the need to create an instance of the class.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/static-keyword)

## Q23 Class & Object Methods in Java?
In Java, both classes and objects can have methods. Methods are functions that define the behaviour or actions that objects of a class can perform.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/class-object-method)

## Q24 Cloning in Java?
In Java, cloning refers to the process of creating a duplicate copy of an object. This can be achieved using the "Cloneable" interface and the "clone()" method.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/cloning)

## Q25 Wrapper Class In Java?
In Java, a wrapper class is a class that wraps (encapsulates) primitive data types within an object. The purpose of wrapper classes is to provide a way to treat primitive data types as objects. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/wrapper-class)

## Q26 Recursion in Java?
Recursion in Java is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem until a base case is reached. 
Recursion is particularly useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/recursion)

## Q27 Call By Value in Java?
In Java, all arguments to methods are passed by value. 
This means that when we pass a parameter to a method, a copy of the value of the parameter is made and passed to the method.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/call-by-value)

## Q28 Call by Reference?
In Java, strictly speaking, there is no "call by reference" mechanism as we have seen in some other programming languages like C++.
 In Java, all arguments to methods are passed by value. However, the confusion arises because when we pass an object to a method, we are actually passing the reference to that object by value. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/call-by-reference)

## Q29 Encapsulation in Java?
Encapsulation in Java is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data (attributes or fields) and methods (functions or procedures) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/encapsulation)

## Q30 Package In Java?
In Java, a package is a way to structure code and organize classes, interfaces, and sub-packages into a single namespace, making it achievable to manage and maintain large-scale Java apps. It helps in avoiding naming conflicts and provides a way to encapsulate related classes and interfaces. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/package)

## Q31 Access Modifier in Java?
Access modifiers in Java are keywords used to set the accessibility or visibility of classes, variables, constructors, and methods. Java provides four types of access modifiers:  `Default`, `Public`, `Private` and `Protected`. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/access-modifier)

## Q32 Abstraction in Java?
Abstraction in Java is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOPs) that focuses on hiding the implementation details of a class while exposing a simplified interface to the users. It allows us to represent complex real-world entities in a simplified manner, emphasizing what an object does rather than how it does it. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/abstraction)

## Q33 Abstract Class in Java?
In Java, an abstraction class is typically an abstract class that serves as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from. Abstraction classes are used to define common characteristics and behaviours that subclasses can inherit and implement.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/abstract-class)

## Q34 Interface in Java?
In Java, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constant declarations, method signatures (without the method body), and default methods (with a default implementation) since Java 8. Interfaces provide a way to achieve abstraction, allowing us to define a contract for classes that implement the interface must adhere to. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/interface)

## Q35 Abstract Vs Interface in Java?
In Java, both abstract classes and interfaces serve as mechanisms for achieving abstraction and defining contracts for classes to implement. However, they have distinct differences in terms of their features and usage: [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/abstract-vs-interface)

## Q36 Inheritance in Java?
In Java, inheritance is a key feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class (subclass or child class) to inherit properties and behaviours (methods and fields) from another class (superclass or parent class). This enables code reuse, promotes modularity, and supports the concept of hierarchical classification. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/inheritance)

## Q37 Polymorphism in Java?
Polymorphism in Java is a core concept of object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass type. It enables flexibility and extensibility in code by allowing methods to behave differently based on the object they are invoked on.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/polymorphism)

## Q38 final keyword in Java?
In Java, the final keyword is a modifier that can be applied to classes, methods, and variables, indicating that they cannot be further modified or overridden. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/final-keyword)

## Q39 super keyword in Java?
In Java, the super keyword is a reference variable that is used to refer to the immediate parent class object. It can be used to access members (variables and methods) of the superclass, call superclass constructors, and distinguish between superclass and subclass members that have the same name. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/super-keyword)

## Q40 Method Overriding in Java?
Method overriding in Java is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This means that a subclass can redefine the behaviour of a method that it inherits from its superclass. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/method-overriding)

## Q41 Method Overloading in Java?
Method overloading in Java is a technique that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. This enables a method to perform different tasks based on the arguments passed to it.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/method-overloading)

## Q42 Runtime Polymorphism?
Runtime polymorphism, also known as dynamic polymorphism, is a key feature of object-oriented programming that allows a method to behave differently based on the actual object type at runtime. It enables you to invoke methods on objects without knowing their specific types at compile time, promoting flexibility and extensibility in your code. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/runtime-polymorphism)

## Q43 Dynamic Binding in Java?
Dynamic binding in Java is a concept closely related to runtime polymorphism, and it refers to the process of determining the actual implementation of a method call at runtime rather than compile time. It enables Java to select the appropriate method implementation based on the type of the object that the method is invoked on. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/java/dynamic-binding)
